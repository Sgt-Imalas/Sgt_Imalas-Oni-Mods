[h3]Mod is marked as "incompatible" / the game is stuck in an "update loop"?[/h3]
This means that the game failed to install the mod. This is usually caused by Ony Mod Manager breaking the download or OneDrive breaking the games' ability to install mods.
Follow [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3522703974]this guide[/url] to fix the OneDrive issue and replace Ony Mod Manager with Mod Updater if not done already.
