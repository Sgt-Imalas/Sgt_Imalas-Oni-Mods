[h1]Introduction[/h1]

Have you ever wanted to [b]truly[/b] automate rockets, just to have been hit with the tetris of cramming a livable space and life support into the rocket to keep the mandatory pilot alive?

[b]Then this mod is for you![/b]

[h1]Current latest Version: 3.0.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Features[/h1]
This mod adds 3 new command modules to your rocket arsenal.
These modules wont allow any duplicants to enter, instead they allow rocket flight without any duplicants inside
The modules are mutually exclusive with other command modules.

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
[list]
    [*]AI Control Module & AI Nosecone are locked behind the research "High Velocity Destruction"
    [*]AI Brain Module is locked behind a new Tech, "Artificial Learning Capabilities", requiring a lot of space science to unlock.
    [*]AI Brains:[list] 
        [*]can be made in the Molecular Forge, requiring a vaccilator recarge amongs some other resources.
        [*]can be named
        [*]can be demolished to refund the ressources
        [*]When loaded into a rocket, the brain will learn while flying, resulting in faster flight speeds at higher piloting levels
    [/list]
[/list] 

[h1]Configuration[/h1]
Mod Options: 
[list]
    [*]"Ai Speed Multiplier" - Set the speed-multiplier the normal AI modules use in flight: 
        0.5 = default autopilot speed (when no dupe sits at the controls of a normal module)
        1.75 = rocket is as fast as a piloted rocket with a maxed out piloting skill (30);
    [*]"Ai Brain Start Multiplier" - Set the speed-multiplier the AI brains start with

[/list]
[h1]Remarks[/h1]
This mod is my first mod ever created.
Additionally, the framework of the rockets in the DLC is a duct taped mess.
Therefore, some parts from the normal rockets are still there, but won't have any function, for example; access control.

before uninstalling, remove all existing AI control modules in the save game, otherwise that save will crash on load.
also demolish all brains if you want to get the vaccilator recharges back.
