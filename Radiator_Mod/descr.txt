[h1]Space Radiator[/h1]

This mod adds a new utility building called “Space Radiator”, that radiates heat off into space.

[h1]Current latest Version: 2.1.0[/h1]

[h1]Features[/h1]
New Building: Space Radiator
[list][*] exchanges heat with the fluid pumped through it.
[*] When the radiator panels are fully exposed to space, it will constantly emit heat radiation into space.
[*] Still exchanges heat with environment (gasses, liquids) when not fully exposed to space, therefore it can be used as a very potent radiant pipe / heatsink.
[*] Can be folded to protect against meteor impacts.
[*] Material choice affects the heat capacity & thermal conductivity of the building
[*] THE SCIENCE™ (Calculates the amount of energy radiated based on the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and and associated calculations, aka: higher temperature => higher cooling rate)
[*] When it breaks, it will close to prevent fully destructing the radiator, however it needs to be repaired to work again.

[h1]DLC Features[/h1]
[list][*] adds a interior exclusive radiator that has to be placed attached to a side wall.

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
[list]    [*]Locked behind the research “Liquid Tuning”.
    [*]Requires 800 refined metal.
[*]Material choice affects radiation rate and heat exchange rate with fluid pumped through.
[*]does not require power
[*]fully rotatable
[*]can be folded by disabling the building either manually or via automation wire. (Disabling won’t stop fluids from getting pumped through.)
[*]due to limitations set by the way the game loads, the radiator will refold itself on loading a save, during this time it’s vulnerable.
