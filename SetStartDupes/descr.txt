[h1]Duplicant Stat Selector - DSS[/h1]

When you start up a new game, there are a lot of dangers for your dupes so you want to prepare carefully.
This mod allows you to adjust the amount of duplicants you start your game with and what Traits and Interests they should have.
You can add more Traits & Interests or just remove those you don't want, all from a handy searchable list.
Furthermore you can store your favourite Stat- or Crew-loadouts as Preset-Templates that you can then load and apply to any dupes created after.
The mod also allows to customize the Personality (Skin) of a dupe without changing any of its stats (for when you want a Pei-Only Colony, but there is no Meep-Mod equivalent).
You can now also modify any dupe that emerges from a cryopod and the mysterious hermit.
The printing pod also gained a handy care package selector.
Furthermore, in sandbox worlds you have now access to a Duplicity style dupe editor.
