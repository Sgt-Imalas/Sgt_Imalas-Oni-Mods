[h1]Features[/h1]
[list][*] New Building: Conveyor Tile
[*] Requires 125KG of refined metal.
[*] Unlocked with the research "Solid Transport".
[*] Duplicants require the "Mechatronic Engineering" skill to build them.
[*] Gasses and Liquids will pass through the conveyor tile (similar to a mesh tile)
[*] When powered, the tile will act as a conveyor belt, moving items towards the chosen direction
[*] Direction can be swapped via ui button, copy settings can be used to mass-change the direction of conveyor tiles
[*] each tile has a logic port that can disable it
[*] doors/solid tiles above the conveyor tile will block items
[*] if a conveyor tile has no tile next to where it is transporting items, the items will fall over the edge
[/list]

[h1]Config[/h1]
[list][*] by default, each tile consumes 4W when active, this can be configured in the mod config
[*] the speed of the conveyor effect can be adjusted in the config (warning: high speeds might lead to dupes no longer being able to walk into the opposite direction of the tile)
[*] if needed, the effect of moving dupes can be disabled in the config (this is not in effect by default)[/list]
