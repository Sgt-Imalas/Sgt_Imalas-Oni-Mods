        Add the file "Player.log" that contains the crash/bug.
        The Message shown during a crash is NOT a log and not very helpful. 
        Add the log file by either dragging it into the text field below or attach it 
        via the file selector that opens when you click the prompt at the bottom of the text field.

        You find your log file under the following path:
        on Windows:
          C:\Users%username%\AppData\LocalLow\Klei\Oxygen Not Included\Player.log
        on Mac:
          ~/Library/Logs/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/Player.log
        on Linux:
        ~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/Player.log        
      placeholder: Click in here to enable drag and drop and to either use that or the built in file selector by clicking the bottom bar afterwards. Then add your log file here
