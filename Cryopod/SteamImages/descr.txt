[h1]Buildable Cryopod (DLC)[/h1]

Upon demolishing a cryopod, one of your Duplicants had a flash of inspiration - "Why don't we rebuild it ourself?"
This mod adds in two constructable cryopods that allow you to freeze your Duplicants in cryosleep.

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.0.0[/h1]

[h1]Features[/h1]

[list]
[*]You cannot research the buildable cryopods like a normal tech - Instead it will be unlocked upon demolishing a Gravitas Cryopod (If all cryopods are already demolished - there is also a chance of unlocking the tech on researching a space artifact at the Artifact Analysis Station)
[*]Cryopods are found under the "Medicine"-building category.
[*]Cryopods are made from 800kg of refined metal, 200kg of glass and 200kg of plastic.
[*]When the pod loses power, the Duplicant inside will start to get cryo damage (indicated by a status item).
[*]If deconstructed while a Duplicant was still inside/thawing, the Duplicant will get thrown out and recieve a lot of cryo damage.
[*]cryo damage scales with the amount of improper thawing.
[*]Duplicants thawed will always recieve Hypothermia, since the technology isn't fully replicated.
